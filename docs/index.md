# SEPlendid
> Your Ultimate SEP Planning tool

![Ui](images/MappingListUi.png)



**SEPlendid is a desktop application for researching on your modules mapping, helping you plan for your upcoming 
Student Exchange Programme (SEP).** While it 
has a GUI, most of the 
user 
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using SEPlendid, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#2-quick-start).
* If you are interested about contributing to SEPlendid, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good 
place to start.
