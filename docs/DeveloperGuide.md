## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ItemListPanel`, `ItemDetailPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/seplendidview/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `SeplendidLogic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `SeplendidLogic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `SeplendidLogic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse`, `University`, `Mapping`, and `Note` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Parser to handle both commands with and without arguments

The below diagram gives a high-level overview on how the `SeplendidParser` parses a command from our command set:
<puml src="diagrams/SeplendidParserActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SeplendidParserActivityDiagram" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mapping feature

The mapping `list/add/delete` mechanism is facilitated by `MappingCatalogue`. It stores `Mapping` objects which
contain the `LocalCode`, `UniversityName`, `PartnerCode` and `MappingMiscInformation` objects. This means that
`Mapping` is dependent on `LocalCourse`, `University` and `PartnerCourse` classes (and their respective
`LocalCourseCatalogue`, `UniversityCatalogue` and `PartnerCourseCatalogue`).

A `UniqueMappingList` is stored internally in `MappingCatalogue`, ensuring that  Additionally, it implements the
following operations (this list is not exhaustive):

* `MappingCatalogue#addMapping(Mapping)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a mapping to the mapping catalogue, and throws a
  `DuplicateMappingException` if the mapping already exists based on the primary key (`LocalCode`, `UniversityName`,
  `PartnerCode`).
* `MappingCatalogue#removeMapping(Mapping)`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes a mapping from the mapping catalogue, and throws a
  `MappingNotFoundException` if the mapping does not exist.
* `MappingCatalogue#hasMapping(Mapping)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks whether a mapping exists in the mapping catalogue, to use to
* prevent duplicate insertion.
* `MappingCatalogue#hasMappingWithLocalCode(LocalCode)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks whether a mapping with the specified `LocalCode`
  exists in the mapping catalogue, to use to prevent deleting a `LocalCourse` with such a `LocalCode`.
* `MappingCatalogue#hasMappingWithPartnerCode(PartnerCode)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks whether a mapping with the specified
  `PartnerCode` exists in the mapping catalogue, to use to prevent deleting a `PartnerCourse` with such a `PartnerCode`.

These operations are exposed in the `SeplendidModel` interface as `SeplendidModel#addMapping(Mapping)`,
`SeplendidModel#deleteMapping(Mapping)`, `SeplendidModel#hasMapping(Mapping)`, `SeplendidModel#hasMapping(LocalCode,
UniversityName, PartnerCode)`,`SeplendidModel#hasMappingWithLocalCode(LocalCode)` and
`SeplendidModel#hasMappingWithPartnerCode(PartnerCode)` respectively.

When the user launches the application for the first time. All relevant data catalogues: `LocalCourseCatalogue`,
`PartnerCourseCatalogue`, `UniversityCatalogue`, `MappingCatalogue` are initialized with the initial state, containing
the seed data for that year's SEP.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addMapping` mechanism works.

<puml src="diagrams/MappingAddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="MappingAddSequenceDiagram" />

Before a mapping is added, the `MappingAddCommand` object will access the `SeplendidModel` instance to check if the
respective `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse` and `University` exists. If any of them does not exist, the command will
not execute `SeplendidModel#addMapping`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, no `CommandResult` will be returned, and hence no update to the UI or
storage files.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `MappingAddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, the `MappingDeleteCommand` object will access the `SeplendidModel` instance to check if the mapping
exists, before deletion. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deleteMapping` mechanism works.

<puml src="diagrams/MappingDeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="MappingDeleteSequenceDiagram" />

`MappingDeleteCommand` will call `SeplendidModel#getMessageIfExists` which returns an `Optional<Mapping>`. If it is
non-empty, the deletion will be performed, otherwise a `CommandException` will be thrown.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the dependency of `Mapping` on `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse` and `University` should be managed:**

* **Alternative 1 (implemented choice):** Disallow deletion of a `LocalCourse` or `PartnerCourse` if it exists in a
  mapping.
  * Note that `Unviersity` entries cannot be deleted as partner universities are fixed for every SEP application
    window.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, prevents accidental deletion.
  * Cons: May have to delete a large number of mappings to remove a course (no force deletion feature).

* **Alternative 2:** Deleting a `LocalCourse` or `PartnerCourse` will delete all its associated mappings.
  * Pros: Will use fewer actions to delete a course, if there exists mappings it is tied to.
  * Cons: We must ensure that deletion cascades, in order to maintain data integrity. This can introduce bugs if not
    done correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Sorting feature
#### Implementation
#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Usage of enum class for attributes**

* **Alternative 1 (implemented choice)**: Use enum class for LocalCourse, PartnerCourse, and Mapping to store the attributes of each data types.
  * Pros: Easy to store constraint messages, easier to keep track of the attributes, can use for other commands such as ```search```.
  * Cons: Need to create new enum classes for each data types.
* **Alternative 2**: Use String to check
  * Pros: Don't need to create new enum classes
  * Cons: Hard to keep track of attributes of each data types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### University Feature

The university `list/search/sort` mechanism is facilitated by `UniversityCatalogue`. It stores `University` objects
which contain the `UniversityName` object. This means that `University` is dependent on `University` class.

A `UniqueUniversityList` is stored internally in `UniversityCatalogue`. Additionally, it implements the following
operations:
- `UniversityCatalogue#hasUniversity(University)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks whether a university exists in the university
  catalogue, to use to prevent duplicate insertion.
  .
  These operations are exposed in the `SeplendidModel` interface as `SeplendidModel#hasUniversity(University).

When the user launches the application for the first time. All relevant data catalogues: `UniversityCatalogue` are
initialised with the initial state, containing the seed data (list of partner universities) for SEP.

Given below is an examples usage scenario and how the `hasUniversity` mechanism works
[//]: # (I'll leave some of the ab3 implementation here so you can refer, please remove if you're the last person)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Effort**

The implementation of SEPlendid proved to be a challenging endeavor. Below is the highlights of the extensive effort our
team dedicated to developing SEPlendid, along with a mention of some of the challenges we encountered along the way.

### Morphing of AB3 to SEPlendid

A large portion of code had to be refactored to morph AB3 to SEPlendid.

### Redesigning the UI

In recognising the significance of minimalism for achieving simplicity, we embarked on the task of redesigning the
original AB3 UI into our custom SEPlendid interface. The endeavor underscored the essential balance between simplicity
and functionality. The effort invested in the redesigning process was substantial, requiring meticulous design
considerations. Striving to meet both aesthetic standards and high functionality, we faced a steep learning curve with
JavaFX. Despite the initial challenges, our team persevered, overcoming obstacles and ultimately producing a UI that not
only met our design goals but also offered a visually appealing and highly functional experience tailored to the
requirements of a student exchange program mapping tool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

This product is for NUS Computing students who are applying for Student Exchange Programme (SEP), who prefer a
faster and more versatile tool to access SEP-related information, compared to the current EduRec system. Seniors who
had underwent the exchange program, or students who learn about courses through their research can also contribute
course mappings.

The following further describes our target users:
* has a need to view course mappings offered by partner universities
* is keen to contribute course mappings
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps


**Value proposition**
SEPlendid aims to provide an advanced search, allowing users to search for mappings by various attributes such
as partner universities' course names, and NUS course codes. We aim to also include features such as the ability to
contribute course mappings, and note-taking.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 course mappings, along with its dependent data such as local courses, without a
    noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands)
    should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.
5.  The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.
6.  The application should be designed to handle a growing database of course mappings and related data.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.
* **Course Mapping**: A course offered by a partner university, which NUS Computing students going on exchange can
  take, and is an equivalent course to one offered in NUS.
* **CLI**: Command-Line Interface is a means of interacting with a computer program b inputting lines of text called
  command-lines.
